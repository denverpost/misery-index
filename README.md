# Misery Index
Let's quantify how miserable the Colorado Rockies are, daily.

## How-to's

### How to set up a dev environment to work on the Misery Index

1. Clone this repo to your computer.
1. Create a virtual environment for this project. (If this item doesn't make sense to you, [https://github.com/denverpost/stat-tracker#how-to-set-up-your-dev-environment](read these instructions here))
1. Activate the virtual env if you haven't yet.
1. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Add two environment variables, `ACCOUNT_USER` and `ACCOUNT_KEY`. You can get the values for these variables by setting up an Oauth2 key for the Misery Index spreadsheet with Google, and [this page will tell you how to set up Oauth2 access to that spreadsheet](http://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html).


### How to set the Misery Index up for a new year

1. Un-comment-out the misery index cron job on prod.
1. Create a new tab and name it after the current year. If you want to hook a Google Form up to the sheet, create the Form ([it should look similar to this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLoPIC6GWdCcP7ib7TRhNkT34zocPZAO7EBe3xz4YxzPwZQQ/viewform)) and after you finish creating it, Google will give you an option to tie it to an existing sheet. Do that.
1. Edit the "YEAR" variable in [deploy.bash](deploy.bash) so it's the current year. 
1. Copy [www/index.html](www/index.html), name it after the previous year. So, in the 2017 season, you would rename www/index.html www/2016.html. Push that new file to production.
1. Edit [the previous year's Misery Index article](http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/25/colorado-rockies-misery-index-2016/) to point to the new previous year's file.
1. Also change the filename of http://extras.denverpost.com/app/misery-index/output/scores.json to http://extras.denverpost.com/app/misery-index/output/scores-PREVIOUSYEAR.json (where "PREVIOUSYEAR" would be 2016 or 2017 or whatever the previous year was), and update the filename reference in the previous year's markup to point to it.
1. Edit www/index.html so it reflects the current season.
1. Sorry this is so janky.
